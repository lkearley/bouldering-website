                <p>Falling correctly is the most important thing to learn when beginning to climb. While there is plenty of padding in indoor climbing gyms, you can still injure yourself if you are not careful.</p>
                <p class="font-weight-bold">Falling on Purpose</p>
                <p>Sometimes when you are in the middle of a climb you will make the active choice to fall off the wall instead of attempting to climb down. In this case, you can follow the steps below to land safely. The video clip to the right demonstrates this technique.</p>
                <p>Push away from the wall → land with bent knees → buckle your knees immediately → fall backwards </p>
                <p class="font-weight-bold">Falling on Accident</p>
                <p>Eventually, you will lose control while climbing and really fall off the wall. In this situation, it is important to try to minimize harm rather than attempting to land gracefully. The most important thing to do in this situation is to attempt to get your feet under you and lean backward. This is to prevent you from landing on your neck or scraping your skin against the wall.</p>

        <p>Before you begin your climb it is important to study the problem for a few moments. Once you get on the wall you will have a hard time seeing which rocks belong to the problem you are trying to solve. Planning your route allows you to move confidently and lessens your chances of getting stuck. Next, start your climb by finding the beginning of your chosen bouldering problem. This will be indicated by a label with the problem difficulty on it. Using only rocks with the same color as the starting one, you can begin to navigate your way up.</p>

                <p class="font-weight-bold">Supporting Your Weight</p>
                <p>When you are climbing, one of your most important resources is your strength, so it is important not to waste it constantly straining to hold yourself up. There are two ways to make sure you are conserving energy. You can choose to either position yourself as close to the wall as possible so your weight is supported as if you were standing, or you can hang off the wall limply. The important thing is that unless you are actively moving to a new hold you should not be pulling yourself towards the wall.</p>

                <p class="font-weight-bold">Moving up the wall</p>
                <p>The way you move up the wall will depend on the difficulty of the route you are climbing. Some will require you to leap for holds, some will require you to use the wall to steady yourself. Climbing gracefully will only come with practice but an important thing to remember is to use your body weight to your advantage. Do not be afraid to shift around to find a steady position before moving on with a route.</p>
