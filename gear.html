        <p>Like most things in life, climbing is not free. Fortunately for beginners, most climbing gyms will lend you free shoes and chalk with your purchase of a day pass or membership. For those who want to purchase their own gear, here is a breakdown of what you need.<p>
        <h1 class="px-3 py-3 pt-md-5 pb-md-4 mx-auto text-center display-4">Shoes</h1>
        <p>The right shoe can make or break your bouldering experience. Climbing shoes should not fit like sneakers. Typically, you want to size a half to two full sizes down from your normal shoe size. The shoes will not be comfortable to walk around in, but they should not be so tight they are difficult to put on. Make sure there is no extra room in the shoe for your foot to move around. This will make it difficult to grip the rocks. There are three different types of shoes, neutral, moderate, and aggressive. The difference between these types of shoes is in the shape of the toe. There are other aspects of the shoe to consider, for example, lace type, but shoe shape is the main factor in performance.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-12 col-md-8">
                <p>You will also need chalk and a chalk bag to start climbing. This is to keep your hands dry and help you grip the rocks. </p>
                <p class="font-weight-bold">Bags</p>
                <p>Chalk bags come in a variety of sizes. Some bags will also come with a hip strap you can use to keep your chalk on you while you climb. However, you probably will not need to use it when you are bouldering indoors. Your chalk bag choice is mostly based on preference. Small bags can be easier to manage if you intend to use the strap while large bags can be nice if you are climbing with a group.</p>
                <p class="font-weight-bold">Chalk</p>
                <p>You will have the option to buy loose chalk or a chalk sock. This decision is up to personal preference. Socked chalk will give a light coating and is generally less messy. On the other hand, loose chalk can give you a heavier coating but is more prone to spill. There are also some non-chalk options for keeping keep hands dry for outdoor climbers or gyms that do not allow chalk.</p>
