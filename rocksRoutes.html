        <p>Bouldering gyms have preset routes you can take which are marked according to their difficulty; these are often referred to as bouldering problems.</p>

            <p class="font-weight-bold">Colors</p>
            <p>When you first enter a bouldering gym you will notice that there is a rainbow of rocks on the walls. These colors are for more than just decoration, they show the rocks you are limited to using to solve that specific problem. In the photo above you can see a green route marked out on the wall. </p>

            <div class="col">

            <p class="font-weight-bold">Difficulty Ranking (V0-V17)</p>
            <p> Each bouldering problem will be labeled according to its difficulty. These labels will also indicate which rock you should start the problem from. If you are new to climbing always start with a V0 to assess your skills. Even if you have some climbing experience its good to start with a V0 to warm up at the beginning of a day at the gym.</p>

            <p class="font-weight-bold">Holds</p>
            <p>A hold is a technical term for a rock on a climbing wall. There are countless types of holds, some are easier to climb for others. The important thing to understand is your grip will change based on the shape of the hold. As you get used to climbing the way you should grip each type of holds will become natural.</p>
            <p class="font-weight-bold">Features</p>
            <p> Sometimes there will be wall attachments which do not quite resemble regular holds. They are made of different materials and seem to be an extension of the wall. These are called features or volumes. The use of these can vary from gym to gym. Some allow them to be used freely to help you with any problem and some will only allow the use of the holds attached to them. Ask your gym staff if they allow the free use of volumes when climbing. </p>
